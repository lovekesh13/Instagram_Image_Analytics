A West Indian Manatee calf nurses from its mom as they settle down on the sandy sea floor in the waters off the coast of Belize, an important country for these endangered animals. Manatees here live in mangroves and often sleep there overnight and feed on nearby sea grass beds during the day. Unlike Florida manatees, these animals are not nearly as acclimated to humans and are shyer. On this morning however, this very relaxed mom and calf allowed me into their world.

Historically these animals have thrived in this region, where come for a few weeks each year to engage in courtship, mating and pupping. But declining sea ice due to climate change over the last decade has caused problems for this species for without stable ice, the pups cannot suckle from their moms and may fall into the icy sea before they are physically prepared. Survival for this species is uncertain if these trends continue.

This area was inhabited for centuries by the San people; rock paintings can be found in caves and shelters across the reserve. An area of climatic extremes, with very cold winters; there is often snow on the mountains and temperatures fall well below zero, with summers that can be uncomfortably hot, with temperatures reaching mid 40 degrees Celsius and higher.
This mountain range is part of the Cape Fold mountain system and the geological formations are chiefly of the Table Mountain group - The reserve’s vegetation is remarkably diverse, featuring renosterveld, mountain fynbos, Karoo-veld, spekboom-veld, and numerous geophytes species.  Most plants flower in spring and some of the low lying areas are transformed into a wonderland as the first rains occur and the dormant plants display their true colours in vast abundance.
Mammals present here include klipspringer, grey rhebuck, kudu, baboon and dassie (rock hyrax). Leopard and caracal (lynx). More than one hundred and thirty bird species have been recorded here, notably black eagle, fish eagle, martial eagle, cape sugarbird and giant kingfisher - love this mountain range, it truly looks like its made from folded layers of marzipan 💚 follow me @chancellordavid to see more work and projects from here and elsewhere #swartbergmountains  #southafrica  #conserving  #wildlife """,1

What orangutans can’t cope with is the dramatic loss of their habitat and the assault on their infants for the illegal pet trade. This young male is one of many orangutans who end up in rehab centers where dedicated people try to give them a new lease on life after their traumatic experiences with humans.

10,0.11067171,0.260330836,"['flame', 'fire', 'roasting', 'wood', 'animal source foods']","Photo by @stevewinterphoto | On October 29th, the government of China revealed that it will allow commercial trade in tiger bone and rhino horn from farmed animals for use in traditional Chinese medicine research and clinical treatments.
Debbie Banks, Environmental Investigation Agency UK, Tiger Campaign Director says: “At a single stroke, China has shattered its reputation as a growing leader in conservation following its domestic ban on the sale of ivory at the start of the year. It is instead revealed as a sham, its international image in tatters and its credibility destroyed—and all for the sake of deeply questionable business sectors which serve only to drive consumer demand for the parts and products of endangered species. History will not judge the Government of China kindly or with respect for such a reactionary, ill-judged and damaging decision.”
China’s action stands in sharp contrast to the country’s moves to combat poaching in recent years. The country has had a 25-year-old ban in place preventing the import or export of these products. And the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies—the official group that dictates what can be used in traditional medicine—also removed rhino horn and tiger bone from its list of products approved for use on patients (though the market still existed for them).
This will further the trade in wild tigers, as the “wild tiger” will now be more valuable than farmed.

Here photographed, the astonishing white sand beach at Detwah Lagoon near Qalansia (Qalansiyah) ... Territorially part of Yemen,  Socotra (Arabic: سُقُطْرَى‎ Suquṭra), is an archipelago of four islands located in the Arabian Sea. The largest island, also known as Socotra, lies about 240km (150mi) east of the Horn of Africa and 380km (240mi) south of the Arabian Peninsula. As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species – up to a third of its plant life is endemic. It has been described as ""the most alien-looking place on Earth”. In the 1990s, a team of United Nations biologists conducted a survey of the archipelago’s flora and fauna and counted nearly 700 species found nowhere else on earth; only New Zealand, Hawaii, New Caledonia, and the Galápagos Islands have more impressive numbers.

Here is a mom and her cubs in the @africanparksnetwork @Zakouma_National_Park. Just 100 years ago there may have been as many as 500,000 lions which roamed the African continent but today there it is estimated that as few as 16,000 - 30,000 remain, and research by lion biologist Hans Bauer and colleagues suggests lions in much of west, east and central Africa will decline by 50% in the next two decades if something dramatic is not done! The biggest threats facing lions in Africa are poaching of their prey and retaliatory killings by farmers when lions eat their cattle! There is also an emerging threat of lions being used in Chinese medicine as tigers become rarer.  @wildaid ""When the buying stops the killing can too”

Poisonings and poaching are the main threats to lions across their East African range. Most lion populations in East, Central and West Africa are declining so the time to act is now. 
There are fewer than 20,000 lions left in Africa, down from 200,000 just 100 years ago - and their long-term future remains in question: they are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, lack of prey, unsustainable hunting and now poaching for their skins, bones, claws and other body parts. But projects like these show how with determination, political will, community support, and simply envisioning a better future, we can bring this species back as well as protect our last wild landscapes, benefiting both wildlife and people, and creating a better existence for all.

There were maggots breeding in his face when he finally died. We all lost another severely endangered black rhino bull to this incident, further depleting the gene pool of a magnificent species that we are losing. It’s no secret that rhinos are severely endangered today, yet China recently declared that it will once again allow trading of rhino and tiger parts domestically after a 25-year ban. They say this is to accommodate “farmed animals” bred in China. There are many reports on those farms, none of them good. Issues of severe inbreeding, starvation, and other abuses are common. There are also many reports that wild animals fetch higher prices on the Chinese market. Any legalization of these animal products throws open large loopholes for the illegal trade, stimulating poaching against severely endangered animals in countries that feed the illegal wildlife trade flowing into China.

Her story is horrifically typical. After encircling her village, the Myanmar military started burning houses. They went house to house and shot the men, including Rohima’s husband. Five months pregnant and in shock, Rohima held her four-year-old to her chest, and her screaming six-year-old to her side. A soldier marched forward, picked up the distraught child, and threw him into the burning flames of a house. The screaming stopped. Somehow, through the tears and choking smoke, Rohima managed to slip away and into the jungle. Her four-year-old and unborn child were safe. But Rohima’s world was shattered. -
One of life’s greatest misconceptions is a simple fable. That time is a healer. One year ago this month “ethnic cleansing” perpetrated by the Myanmar military against the Rohingya sparked a massive refugee crisis. Nearly a million Rohingya – those who escaped the flames and executions – are now living in camps in Bangladesh. Many of them were raped, most saw loved ones killed, thousands arrived wounded. All are traumatized. Here, in this impoverished monsoon soaked corner of Bangladesh, is one of the most densely populated areas of PTSD affected and depressed people on earth.
